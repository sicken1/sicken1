## 🐾 Meow! I'm Sicken 🐾  

Just another cat who survived the student years of IT.  
Spent days debugging, nights panicking, and still here — coding anyway. 🐈‍⬛  

---

### 💻 What’s this place?
My testing ground — where I break things to learn.  
A safe space for experiments, drafts, and random front-end magic.  
**One Pawstep at a time**.  

---

### 🎓 My Student Years
- Spent countless hours learning HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and a little Laravel, Django
- Built capstone projects that nearly broke my brain and my laptop(actually it broke😿)
- Learned more from trial and error than any tutorial ever taught 
- Found out that *"it finally worked!"* is the sweetest phrase in tech  

---

### ⚙️ Currently Scratching At
- Front-end experiments 🧩  
- Turning chaos into code (slowly... but surely)  

---

### 💤 Fun Fact
I’m still that lazy cat — but I don’t give up easily.  
Because every failed code just means… another *meow try*. 😸
